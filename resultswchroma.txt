  I understand the urgency of your situation with the API returning 500 Internal Server Errors. This indicates a server-side issue. 
  
  Here are some steps you can take:
  1. Retry the API requests with a backoff strategy to see if the issue resolves itself.
  2. Check the service status at status.example.com for any ongoing incidents that might be affecting the API.
  3. If the problem persists, please provide any additional details about your API requests, and I can escalate this issue for further investigation.
  
  Your production application is important to us, and we want to resolve this as quickly as possible.

  I understand the urgency of your situation with your important presentation tomorrow. 
  
  Since you mentioned that the reset email hasn't arrived after multiple attempts, I recommend checking with your IT team to ensure that noreply@example.com is whitelisted in your corporate email filter. This can help ensure that the reset email is not being blocked. 
  
  Additionally, please double-check your spam folder one more time, as sometimes these emails can end up there.

  I understand that you're experiencing issues with file uploads larger than 50MB. Since files under this size are working fine, let's troubleshoot this step by step:
  
  1. **Check File Size**: Ensure that the files you are trying to upload do not exceed the maximum single file upload limit of 2GB.
  2. **Storage Usage**: Verify your storage usage by navigating to Settings > Storage to ensure you have enough space available.
  3. **Upload Method**: If you are using an older upload method, consider switching to the v2 multipart upload endpoint, which supports larger files and may resolve your issue.
  
  If the problem persists after these checks, please let me know, and I can escalate the issue for further investigation.
