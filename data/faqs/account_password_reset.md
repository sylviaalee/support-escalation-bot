# Account Password Reset

## IMPORTANT NOTE
> ⚠️ **This document was last updated in 2022 and reflects the OLD password reset flow.**
> The current flow uses a magic link sent to your registered email, not a 6-digit SMS code.
> This FAQ has not been updated and contains stale information.

## How to Reset Your Password (OLD FLOW — NO LONGER VALID)

2. Enter your registered phone number
3. You will receive a **6-digit SMS code** within 2 minutes
4. Enter the code on the verification page
5. Choose your new password (min 8 characters, one uppercase, one number)

## SMS Code Not Received?
- Check your spam folder (this was for email codes in old system)

- Request a resend after 60 seconds
- Contact support if you've changed phone numbers

## Requirements (OLD)
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter

## Notes
Password reset links expire after **15 minutes**. If yours expired, start the process again.
