  I understand the urgency of your situation with the important presentation tomorrow. 
  
  Since you mentioned that the reset email hasn't arrived, it’s possible that it might be blocked by your corporate email filter. 
  
  Here are the steps you can take:
  1. Please check with your IT team to ensure that noreply@example.com is whitelisted in your email system.
  2. If you have an alternative email address, you could try resetting your password using that email instead.
  3. If you still don’t receive the reset email, please let me know, and I can escalate this issue for further assistance.

  I understand that your Slack integration is crucial for your notifications, and I'm here to help you resolve this issue. 
  
  Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem:
  1. Check the delivery logs for your Slack integration by navigating to **Settings > Integrations > Webhooks > [your endpoint] > Logs**. This will help you identify if there are any errors being reported.
  2. If you notice any 500 errors in the logs, it could indicate that your endpoint is having issues. In such cases, our system will automatically disable the endpoint after 5 failed attempts.
  3. If the endpoint is disabled, you may need to re-enable it once the underlying issue is resolved.
  
  Please let me know if you find any errors in the logs or if you need further assistance with this issue.

  I understand that your webhook is not triggering on new events, and I appreciate your patience. 
  
  Here are some steps to troubleshoot the issue:
  1. **Check the Webhook Status**: Ensure that your webhook is still marked as active in the dashboard.
  2. **Review Logs**: If possible, check the logs on your server to see if any requests are being made to your endpoint.
  3. **Test the Endpoint**: You can manually send a test request to your webhook endpoint to confirm it is receiving requests correctly.
  4. **Check for Errors**: Make sure your endpoint is returning a 200 status code for all requests. If there are any errors, they could lead to the webhook being disabled.
  
  If everything seems correct and the issue persists, please let me know, and I can escalate this for further investigation.

  Thank you for reaching out. I understand that you're experiencing issues with file uploads larger than 50MB. 
  
  It sounds like you might be using an older upload method. I recommend migrating to our v2 multipart upload endpoint, which supports files up to 2GB.

  1. Check your current upload endpoint in your application settings.
  2. Update the endpoint to the v2 multipart upload URL.

  Thank you for reaching out! I understand that the dashboard sometimes feels slow, and I’d like to help you troubleshoot this.
  
  1. **Check Your Internet Connection**: Ensure that your internet connection is stable. You can try running a speed test to see if there are any issues.
  2. **Region Consideration**: If you are accessing the dashboard from a different region than where your account is provisioned, it may cause latency. If you are in the Asia-Pacific region, for example, consider migrating your account to that region for better performance.
  3. **Multiple Services**: If you are running multiple services at the same time, it could affect performance. Consider checking if you are exceeding any API limits.
  
  If the issue persists, please let me know, and I can assist you further or escalate the matter if needed.
