  Thank you for reaching out regarding the unexpected charge on your credit card. I understand how concerning this can be. 
  
  To assist you better, could you please confirm if you have checked your account for any active subscriptions? Sometimes, charges can occur if there are multiple accounts or if there were overages on a plan. 
  
  If you believe this charge is indeed an error, I can help you initiate a refund process. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I will assist you accordingly.

  I understand the urgency of your situation with the API returning 500 Internal Server Errors. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:
  
  1. **Check API Key**: Ensure that your API key is valid and not expired. You can verify this in your account settings.
  2. **Authorization Header**: Make sure you are including the API key in the correct format. It should be in the header as follows: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.
  3. **Server Status**: If you have access, check your server logs for any errors that might indicate why the API is failing.
  4. **Endpoint Status**: If your endpoint has been auto-disabled due to multiple failed attempts, you may need to re-enable it once the underlying issue is resolved.
  
  If you've checked these and are still experiencing issues, please provide any error messages or logs you have, and I can escalate this for further investigation.
